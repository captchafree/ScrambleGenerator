# ScrambleGenerator
A customizable random state Rubik's Cube scrambler

This framework uses a random state scrambler to generate scrambles for a Rubiks' Cube. Instead of constructing a scramble by creating a random sequence of moves, a randomly scrambled representation of a Rubik's Cube is generated and then a solving algortihm is applied to it. The scramble generated is the inverse of the solution. This process is described in detail below.
